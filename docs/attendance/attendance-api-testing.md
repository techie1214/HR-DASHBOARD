# 📡 Attendance API Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start: Setting Up Your Token

### Option 1: Get Token via Login Command

```bash
# Step 1: Login and save token to a variable
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
  }' | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Step 2: Verify token was saved
echo "Token: ${TOKEN:0:50}..."
```

### Option 2: Use Your Already-Copied Token

```bash
# If you already have the token as text, just paste it here:
TOKEN="paste_your_full_token_here"

# Verify it's set
echo "Token is set: ${#TOKEN} characters"
```

### Option 3: Export Token for Current Terminal Session

```bash
# Copy your token, then run:
export TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Now all commands below will work in this terminal session
```

---

## ✅ Verify Token is Set

Before running any commands, verify your token is set:

```bash
echo $TOKEN
```

If you see a long string of characters, you're ready! If you see nothing, set the token first.

## 📍 1. CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT

> ⚠️ **Important:** The `location_coordinates` field must use MySQL POINT format: `"POINT(longitude latitude)"` - NOT a JSON object.

### Check-In (On Time) - With Location
**What it does:** Marks your arrival at work with GPS location verification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2026-03-03",
    "check_in_time": "09:00:00",
    "location_coordinates": "POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)",
    "location_address": "London Office, UK"
  }'
```

### Check-In (On Time) - Without Location (Simplest for Testing)
**What it does:** Marks your arrival without location verification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2026-03-03",
    "check_in_time": "09:00:00"
  }'
```

### Check-In (Late - After Shift Start)
**What it does:** Marks late arrival (after scheduled shift start time)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2026-03-03",
    "check_in_time": "09:30:00",
    "location_coordinates": "POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)",
    "location_address": "London Office, UK"
  }'
```

### Check-Out - With Location
**What it does:** Marks your end-of-day departure with location verification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-out \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2026-03-03",
    "check_out_time": "17:30:00",
    "location_coordinates": "POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)",
    "location_address": "London Office, UK"
  }'
```

### Check-Out - Without Location (Simplest for Testing)
**What it does:** Marks your end-of-day departure without location
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-out \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2026-03-03",
    "check_out_time": "17:30:00" 
  }'
```

## 💡 HELPER SCRIPTS

### Create a Test Script File

Save this as `test-attendance.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Attendance API Test Script
# Usage: ./test-attendance.sh

# Set your token here or export it before running
export TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Colors for output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

echo -e "${GREEN}=== Attendance API Tests ===${NC}"
echo ""

# Test 1: Check-In (NO location - simplest)
echo -e "${GREEN}Test 1: Check-In${NC}"
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "date": "'$(date +%Y-%m-%d)'",
    "check_in_time": "09:00:00"
  }' | jq .

echo ""

# Test 2: Get Today's Attendance
echo -e "${GREEN}Test 2: Get Today's Attendance${NC}"
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/my?date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .

echo ""
echo -e "${GREEN}=== Tests Complete ===${NC}"
```

Make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x test-attendance.sh
./test-attendance.sh
```

---

### Create Aliases for Quick Testing

Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Attendance API Aliases
alias att-checkin='curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-in -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d'
alias att-checkout='curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/check-out -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d'

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Token Not Working?
```bash
# Check if token is set
echo $TOKEN

# If empty, set it again
export TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Getting 401 Unauthorized?
- Your token may have expired. Login again and get a new token.
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the token.

### Getting 403 Forbidden?
- Your user account doesn't have the required permission for that endpoint.
- Contact your admin to grant the necessary permissions.

### JSON Not Formatted Nicely?
- Install `jq` for pretty JSON output:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install jq
  
  # macOS
  brew install jq
  ```

---

## 📝 NOTES

1. **`$TOKEN`** - This variable holds your JWT authentication token
2. **`jq`** - Command-line JSON processor for pretty output (optional but recommended)
3. All dates should be in **YYYY-MM-DD** format
4. All times should be in **HH:MM:SS** format (24-hour)
5. **Location coordinates format** (IMPORTANT!):
   - ✅ Correct: `"POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)"` (MySQL POINT format: longitude first, then latitude)
   - ❌ Wrong: `{"latitude": "51.5074", "longitude": "-0.1278"}` (JSON object won't work)
   - For testing, you can omit location entirely and just send date + time

---

**Happy Testing! 🎉**
